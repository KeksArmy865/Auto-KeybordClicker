All Softwares are made for the hole world because no KeybordClickers without Viruses is there i guess and this software is without Viruses and malware!

IMPORTANT:Before installation, please disable antivirus programs like Avast! You do not need to disable Windows Defender! - Please add the .exe file as an exception, as it is mistakenly detected by Avast as spyware. However, as you can see in the code, this is not 
the case. I have asked Avast to analyze the file more thoroughly so that this warning no longer appears. According to ChatGPT, the issue is likely caused by the conversion to a .exe file in Windows, since the code was not flagged when it was executed directly via 
Python.

Do not resize the pogramm it locks weird!
